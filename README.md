# OBJECT-DETECTION-USING-OPEN-C.V
Developed a real-time object detection system using OpenCV and pre-trained deep learning models (SSD + MobileNet) to accurately identify, classify, and localize objects in images and video streams, bounding box visualization and Non-Maximum Suppression for efficient detection in applications like surveillance, robotics, and autonomous systems.
